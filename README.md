### Hello! Welcome to my Github page. Hope you like it!

I'm a junior full stack web.

I know `Ruby`, `Ruby on Rails`, `JaveScript`, `HTML`, `CSS` `React` & `Expo`

I work with Test Driven Development, and when i do I use `Cypress`, `RSpec` & a little bit of `Jest`

I'm working on getting my Bachelor's Degree in Media- and Communication Science. 
My dream is to be a FULL full stack web developer wher I can code the frontend and backend, know Media- and Communication Science well enought to know what type of communication you should use on the frontend and to sharpen my styling skills in order to present the web page in a attractive way.

Fun Facts: 
* I like drawings, both consuming and creating 
* I have the certificate Fartygsbef√§ll klass 8, if you'r looking for a boat ride 
* I was the captain for the football team Sollentuna IF, the worst football team in the lowest division (but I still love them to death)
